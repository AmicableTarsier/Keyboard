# Keyboard

This repo is built as a custom animation on the Nullbitsco Nibble keyboard.

Huge shoutout to @tokolist who helped me decipher a lot of code. My code is heavily inspired by their optimization of JBaguley's Corne keyboard build

The bulbasaur sprites are sourced from the pokencyclopedia.info. Flipped the sprites to face left to right. They were traced in pixilart and output as a .png
